# CPTT
The project for the course of Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools in Nanjing University.
It aims to implement a complier for C--, whose syntax is less complicated than C/C++. 
The project is divided into four parts: lexical and syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation and MIPS32 code generation (unfinished).
