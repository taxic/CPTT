# CPTT
The project for the course of **C**ompilers: **P**rinciples, **T**echniques, and **T**ools in Nanjing University.
It aims to implement a complier for C--, whose syntax is less complicated than C/C++. 
The project is divided into four parts: lexical and syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation and MIPS32 code generation (unfinished).
